# Step-Counter
A Step-Counter built using the NodeMCU 
This project uses an MPU6050 accelerometer to measure acceleration along the three axes. This data is then processed by the NodeMCU using the peak-finding algorithm to determine if a step has been made
The NodeMCU peridocially pushed the data to Firebase.
